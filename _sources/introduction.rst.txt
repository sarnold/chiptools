What is ChipTools?
==================

ChipTools is a build and verification framework for FPGA designs.

What can it do?
===============

ChipTools aims to simplify the process of building and testing FPGA designs by
providing a consistent interface to vendor applications and automating simulation and synthesis flows.

Key features
------------

    * Seamlessly switch between vendor applications without modifying build scripts or project files.
    * Enhance testbenches with Python based stimulus generation and checking.
    * Automate test execution and reporting using the Python Unittest framework.
    * Automatically check and archive build outputs.
    * Preprocess and update files before synthesis to automate tasks such as updating version registers.
    * Free and open source under the `Apache 2.0 License <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_.
