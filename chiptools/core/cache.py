    A FileCache instance can be used to create and maintain a cache of
    fileObjects so that file changes can be detected to allow intelligent
    recompilation. The FileCache accepts a project file path during creation,
    the cache file will be generated in the same directory as the Project file
    and will use a name derived from the Project file name. File objects can
    be added to the cache and the is_file_changed method can be used to
    determine if a given File object has been modified since it was last added
    to the cache.

    Internally the cache file is stored as a Pickled dictionary of two items:
        * LIBRARIES : A set of libraries that were added to the cache using
        *add_library*
        * FILES : A dictionary of file path / file md5 sum pairs
        of files added using *add_file*
